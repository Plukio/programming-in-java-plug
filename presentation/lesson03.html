				<h2>Introduction to Software Testing</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Testing</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Testing aims to determine the degree of alignment between reality and expectations.</li>
					<li>It helps measure quality but cannot directly influence it.</li>
					<li>It provides information to stakeholders.</li>
					<li>It is an ongoing activity, not a development phase.</li>
					<li>It is the responsibility of the entire team, not an isolated role.</li>
					<li>
						The goal of testing is to:
						<ul>
							<li>Verify that the product does what is expected of it.</li>
							<li>Provide information.</li>
							<li>Identify problems, not just bugs.</li>
							<li>Reduce risks.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The goal of testing is not to make decisions but to provide information to support decision-making (the tester is not the decision-maker).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Quality</h3>
				<p>What is quality, and how does it relate to testing and the product?</p>
				<blockquote>
					Is a product considered good quality if it contains no errors?
				</blockquote>
				<p>A product is something someone desires because it satisfies certain needs.</p>
				<p>We can view the quality of a product from two perspectives:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>What the product does</strong> = external quality.</li>
					<li><strong>How it does it</strong> = internal quality.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>External and Internal Quality</h3>
				<table>
					<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>External Quality</strong><br />
							<ul>
								<li>Does the product fulfill user's needs?</li>
								<li>Does it operate in a way that is usable for the user?</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
						<td>
							<strong>Internal Quality</strong><br />
							<ul>
								<li>Is the software well written?</li>
								<li>Is the code readable and understandable?</li>
								<li>Is the code designed well?</li>
								<li>Is the code testable? Is the test coverage sufficient?</li>
								<li>Is there sufficient documentation?</li>
								<li>Is there sufficient logging?</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<div style="font-size: 80%">
					<p>
						While it is possible for product with relatively low internal quality to have high external quality,
						it is not surprising, that the two usually correlate. When software is testable, it is easier to extend and maintain,
						requiring both less skill and time, making it more resistant to <strong>regression</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Regression</strong> == in terms of testing, regression is a defect unintentionally introduced by a change into a previously working part of software.

								Dynamic
								<ul>

								Static
								<ul>
									<li>Code is not executed during testing</li>

				<h2>Unit Testing</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
				<p>
					The purpose of unit testing is to verify individual units of the code base work as intended by the author.
					It is an essential tool in maintaining <strong>internal quality</strong> of a software.
				</p>
				<p>
					Units == smallest testable parts of the software, such as individual methods, functions or objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important role of unit testing is documentation. By writing unit tests, we document the behavior
					we intended, so that when we, or someone else wants to make changes in the software, they will understand
					how the software was supposed to work.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Test Case</h3>
				<p>
					Test conditon =
					A testable aspect of a component or system identified as a basis for testing.

					In other words, some behavior we expect from the code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Test case =
					A set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and postconditions, developed based on test conditions.

					In other words, test case is a sequence of action steps with preconditons, inputs and expected results.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Assertion</h3>
				<p>
					Assertion is a term used form mechanism of verifying if test expected outcomes match actual outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Assertion itself is usually a function (method) that we call in our tests which evaluates actual value with expected value.
					Based on result of this evaluation, the assertion ends in one of two states
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>passed</li>
					<li>failed</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Test may contain any number of assertions, anywhere within the test.</p>

				<p>When a test is run, and no assertion fails, the test is marked as passed.</p>
				<p>When a test is run, and any assertion fails, the test is marked as failed.</p>
				<p>Generally, when assertion fails, test is ended immediately. Any code following the assertion is not executed.</p>

				<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
				<p>
					You may encounter the term <strong>Test Driven Development</strong> (TDD).
					Know that, although the term suggest it might be testing technique, it really is not.
					Rather it is a software design technique.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In TDD, you write a tests first, they will initially be failing.</li>
					<li>Then you start implement the functionality.</li>
					<li>When all the tests finally pass, your implementation is complete.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The reason TDD is development technique and not a test technique is because by writing tests
					first, you are making code testable by design. Well-testable code usually directly correlates with
					code quality and therefore overall software quality.
