# Lesson 1
Introduction to development in Java

## Basic Java Syntax

**HelloWorld**
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Data Types
- null

### Variables
- assignment operator

### Arithmetic Operators

### Logical Operators
### Comparison Operators
### Conditionals
### Arrays


## Practice

### Exercise 1: Data Types
In the `Lesson01Main` class, define variables that will hold information about the city of Bangkok:
- City name
- Country name
- If it is a country's capital city
- Year city was established
- City cityPopulation
- City area in m2
- Country cityPopulation (of Thailand)
- Country area in m2

Try to use as many of the different types Java has as you can think of, consider their limits.

What data type would be best for what property and why?


### Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operators

Write code, that will do the following arithmetic operations and save each ot a new variable:
 1. Calculate city age in years
 2. Calculate city population density for km2
 3. Calculate city area in m2
 4. Calculate city population density for m2
 5. Calculate how much % of Thailand city population lives in Bangkok (as decimal number)

Use `System.out.println(value);` to write results to console.

Some of the result have very high number of decimal numbers. What could we do about it?

Add
```
cityAge++;
System.out.println(cityAge);
```
What happens and why?

Run the program.
